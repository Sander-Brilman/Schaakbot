# Chess bot

#### To play [click here]()

I made this project for fun wondering if i could make a chess bot from scratch not knowing a damn thing about how chess bots work.<br>

To view the code and see how it works the `assets/php/functions.php` file is the place to be. Almost all chess bot code is written & divided in functions.

## What i used

This is a self made chess bot from scratch. I did not use any chess libraries or follow tutorials to make this. 
<br>
The languages i used are:
- PHP (for backend & move processing)
- Jquery (for live updating)
- HTML & CSS (for building the website itself)

I used my own [php website template](https://github.com/Sander-Brilman/php-website-template) to take care of the basics of the websites


For the icons i used FontAwsome


## Short history

I stared with a simple (and very slow) vanilla javascript bot in a basic html page. With every new version it got better and faster until it grew to this current version.<br>

This latest version is the first to process the moves on the backend and live update the changes.<br>




All the previous verison use pure vanilla js only. To view the code you can use the dev tools.
